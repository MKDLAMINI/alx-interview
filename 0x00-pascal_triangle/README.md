This project includes a function pascal_triangle(n) that generates Pascal's Triangle up to the nth row. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients, where each number is the sum of the two directly above it.
Function Description
pascal_triangle(n)

    Parameters:
        n (int): The number of rows of Pascal's Triangle to generate. Assumed to be an integer.

    Returns:
        A list of lists of integers representing Pascal's Triangle up to the nth row.
        Returns an empty list if n <= 0.
